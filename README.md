Mastermind (Unity3D In-Editor Game)
======
What is it?
------------
This is a game built with Unity 3D, that can be played WITHIN the Editor of Unity 3D.
It was built to explore the extension capabilities of Unity 3D, and of course, to do a short game between at any time while designing and creating games with Unity.

Requirements
------------
* Unity 3D 4.0 or above (http://unity3d.com/)

How to use and how to play?
------------
Copy the contents of the Assets Folder (except the MasterMind.unity file, which is the demo) into your Unity Project. Whenever you want to play MasterMind now, just drag the MastermindPlayable script onto any game object in your scene and watch a new component Mastermind appear in your editor.
Choose the colors you want to set and click evaluate to see if you guessed it right. Indicators (black = right color and right position, white = position doesn't match) as well as a winning message will visualize your match. After you're done, click reset to clean up your scene ;)

For detailed gameplay rules have a look at the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_%28board_game%29#Gameplay_and_rules)
